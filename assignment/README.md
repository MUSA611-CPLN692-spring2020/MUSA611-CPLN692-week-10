# Final Project Proposal

Your assignment this week is to write a detailed proposal for your final
project. In proposing your final, try to address each of the following
areas. Please produce at least a paragraph which addresses the topics below

## Problem / Question

Applications are ultimately just tools. What problem or question does
your application attempt to resolve or grapple with? How does your
application speak to this problem/question?

The objective of my project is to create an interactive web to present
the distribution of coronavirus and public sentiment about the epidemic.
Generally, there are many digital application for coronavirus query, but
there is less concern about the public sentiment. This application can
monitor the public words on Twitter to listen to what people really
say about the coronavirus. Also, the application can help people find
 the best route to hospital or testing station, in case they have any
  mental or physical need.



## The data

Geospatial applications are all about working with data. What datasets
would you plan/like to use? If the data you'll be working with isn't
already stored in a way that you can use, how will you be storing your data?

The coronavirus data is from CDC. The hospital data is from opendata.
The Twitter data is sampling scraped online.

## Technologies used

Which technologies covered in class (or discovered on your own!) do you
plan to use? How do you anticipate using each of these technologies?

Review the APIs/online examples of leaflet, turf, jQuery, underscore (or
any library not explicitly covered in class) for functions/uses which
you'd like to explore. Briefly describe how you might use them.

The library such as leaflet, turf, jQuery as well as Mapbox API will be
covered in this project.

## Design spec

#### User experience

At a high level, how do you expect people to use your application?
- Who are the users?
The people who is concern about the coronavirus epidemic or
need to find a route to hospital. The government department which need to
 learn the public sentiment and prevent the outbreak of group panic.
- What do they gain from your application' use?
They can visually understand the US epidemic situation and get access to hospital.
- Are there any website/application examples in the wild to which you can compare your final?
CDC has provided the map of coronavirus. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html\
But there is no similar application about public sentiment.



#### Layouts and visual design

So far, we've built all our applications with a side bar for
representing non-map content and navigation. This is not the only
successful design. Extra content could be displayed in a top bar,
through modals, through side bars on both sides, and any combination of
these as well as a number not mentioned. Try to describe your
application's visual layout. Conceptually (no need for extensive CSS
here), what will this design require?


The extra chart is a good way to show the situation of the area that the user is concerned about. Linked icons should be the key to good design

## Anticipated difficulties

Thinking about weaknesses can be useful. What do you anticipate being
most difficult about this project? How will you attempt to cope with
these difficulties? For example, asynchronous behavior (ajax, events)
are hard to use and think about. Global variables are a strategy for
coping with that difficulty by breaking data out of the asynchronous
context.


## Missing pieces

We've only managed to scratch the surface of the available technologies
by which you could construct an application. What use-cases haven't we covered
that you think would be useful? What technologies not covered seem exciting to
you (you don't necessarily have to fully understand what they're for,
this is a chance for you to get help interpreting a technology's
purpose/usage).
